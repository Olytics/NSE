Modelling Volatility of Nigerian Stock Market
The data consists of daily stock prices from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) covering the period from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020. The project aims to analyze and predict market volatility using models such as ARCH, GARCH, EGARCH, and TGARCH.

Here are the questions I was interested in answering:
1. What is the overall volatility trend in the Nigerian stock market over the studied period?
2. How do different volatility models compare in capturing the market's volatility?
3. Are there significant leverage effects present in the market volatility?
4. How accurately can the selected models forecast future volatility?

I took the following steps to create my analysis:
1. Collected daily stock prices and other relevant data from the Nigerian Stock Exchange.
2. Performed preliminary data analysis, including calculating descriptive statistics and conducting stationarity tests.
3. Applied various econometric models (ARCH, GARCH, EGARCH, TGARCH) to capture and analyze market volatility.
4. Conducted model diagnostics to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.
5. Evaluated and compared model performance using criteria such as AIC and BIC.

Here are my key takeaways:
1. The GARCH model provided the most accurate representation of volatility in the Nigerian stock market.
2. Significant leverage effects were detected, with negative shocks having a greater impact on volatility.
3. The selected models demonstrated strong predictive power for future market volatility.
